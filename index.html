                <h3>THE PRELUDE</h3>
                <p>
                    Once upon a time, there were three little pigs.  
                    Their names were Jack, Mack &#38; Dack, and they lived happily with their mother.  
                    But one day, their mother told them it was time to go out into the world.  
                    She warned them to watch out for the big bad wolf, and sent them on their way.        
                </p>

                <p>
                    Jack, Mack, and Dack walked until they reached a fork in the road.
                    Jack went right.  Mack went left.  Dack continued on straight.
                    Jack met a man with some straw, which he bought to build a house.  It took no time at all.
                    Mack met a man with some sticks, which he bought to build his house.  
                        It took a little longer, but not very.

                <p>
                    Dack bought some bricks and took a long time to build a 
                    big, strong house.

                </p>
                  
                
                <h3>THE WOLF ARRIVES</h3>
                    <img C:\Users\Jackie\lc101\html-me-something\images\wolf.jpg>
                    
                    <p>
                    The big bad wolf was getting hungry.  He approached Jack's straw house, knocked on the door,
                    and shouted:
                    
                    <div class='wolf'>little pig, little pig, LET ME IN!'</div>

                    Jack replied:
                    
                    <div class='pig'> not by the hair on my chinny chin chin' </div>

                    The wolf shouted back:
                    
                    <div class='wolf'>then i will huff, and i will puff, and blow your house in! </div>


                    And he huffed, and he puffed, and blew the straw house down.
                    Jack ran away as fast as he could to his brother Mack's stick house.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The big bad wolf was getting even hungrier.
                    
                    He approached Mack's stick house, knocked on the door,
                    and shouted:
                    
                    <div class='wolf'>little pigs, little pigs, LET ME IN!'</div>

                    Jack and Mack replied:
                    
                    <div class='pig'> not by the hair on our chinny chin chins!' </div>

                    The wolf shouted back:
                    
                    <div class='wolf'>then i will huff, and i will puff, and blow your house in! </div>

                    And he huffed, and he puffed, and blew the Stick house down.
                    Mack and Jack ran away as fast as they could Dack's brick house.
                </p>


                <h3>THE CONCLUSION</h3>

                <p>
                    The big bad wolf was STARVING.
                    
                    He approached Dack's brick house, knocked on the big strong door,
                    and shouted:
                    
                    <div class='wolf'>little pigs, little pigs, LET ME IN!'</div>

                    Jack, Mack, and Dack replied:
                    
                    <div class='pig'> not by the hair on our chinny chin chins' </div>

                    The wolf hollered back:
                    
                    <div class='wolf'>then i will huff, and i will puff, and blow your house in! </div>

                    And he huffed, and he puffed,      
                    
                    <div class='puffy'> and he huffed and he puffed </div>>

                    And the house stood firm.  
                    Eventually, he decided to try the chimney.  
                    It did not go well. 

                    Dack stoked the fire under his dinner.
                    
                    The 3 little pigs lived happily ever after in Dack's brick house.
